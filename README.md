Another programmer was in the group, I'll list what I worked on:

#CharacterEditor
I worked on the CharacterEditor menu, which allows us to change the color of our birds, it's a very simple editor

#CompagnonTuto
I worked on a little companion who helps us in the game tutorial

#Ennemy
I worked on an Enemy which is a simple AI that shoots at the player while moving

#PickUpSystem
I worked on the pickup system, we have 2 pickups in our game, coins and eggs

#HUD / UI / Menus
I worked on the different HUD / UI and menu in the game but not completely
